# Sonar Adapter

On revision A of the HR2 master board, the sonar connectors are rotated 180 degrees.
Sonar connector pins 1 and 4 of are directly connected to the 5V/ground planes the HR2 master board.
There is no way to patch the HR2 master board to fix thus.
Hence, the Sonar Adapter PCB kludges around this problem by reversing the pins.
